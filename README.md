# CEC Contacts
CEC Contacts is a mobile web application that uses the California Energy Commission public phone list to provide a user friendly experience when searching for employee contact information. CEC personnel can be filtered using any combination of first and last names, division, or office. Tapping on a selected employee's phone number or email address will open the device's built-in phone or mail applications, allowing easy communication with that particular contact. 

## Inspiration
While employed as a student for the California Energy Commission, my supervisor desired a simple way to call or email CEC colleagues using his smartphone. The CEC provided a public phone list on their desktop website, but a mobile version was not available. Since the website was not optimized for smartphones, it was difficult to operate and forced users to copy and paste contact information into the smartphone's built-in phone or mail applications. After doing some research, I found that a mobile web application would effectively solve the identified problems and could be used by smartphone users without having to sideload or download a native application onto their devices.
