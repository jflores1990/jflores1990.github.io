# CEC Contacts

CEC Contacts is a mobile web application that has been optimized for iOS and Android phones. Using the California Energy Commission's public phone list, the application provides a user friendly mobile experience that allows the user to search for a California Energy Commission employee's contact information. Employees can be filtered by using any combination of "First Name", "Last Name", "Division", or "Office". Once the desired employee is found, CEC Contacts provides the smartphone user with the ability to call or email the selected employee by tapping on the phone number or email address, which will open the device's built in phone or mail application.

## Inspiration
While working at the California Energy Commission as a student, my supervisor desired a simple way to call or email his CEC colleagues using his smartphone. The California Energy Commission provided a public phone list on their desktop site, but it was difficult to use on a smartphone. The desktop phone list site also did not provide a smartphone user with the ability to make a call or compose an email without having to copy and paste the phone number or email address into the smartphone's built in phone or mail applications. After doing some research, I decided that a mobile web application seemed like the best solution, since it could be used by both iOS and Android phone users without having to sideload or download a native application onto their devices. 

## How to Use
